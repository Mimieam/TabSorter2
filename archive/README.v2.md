## New Direction

First of, I would like to thank you all for the love and support, from all your emails and comments! I really wish I could have kept working on TS2 for free, but as the past few years have shown, that isn't sustainable anymore.

>So starting with version 2.0.0, TabSorter2 will be a subscription-based extension following a freemium model.


What was once a little weekend project 6 years ago has turned into a daily commitment with little to no rewards. Don't get me wrong, I truly love working on TS2, especially coming up with fun new features to enhance the browsing experience. I have plans for many new features, options, and enhancements on the [Roadmap] and strongly desire to bring TS2 to other browsers! In short, I want to focus on that without worries of becoming homeless üòÖ


And if I've learned anything from migrating to Manifest... massive, free refactoring work doesn't pay the bills ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So what can you expect with **TabSorter2 v2.0.0**?
- The basic core features, **Merge/Sort/Shuffle/Save/Load** along with bug fixes/security updates, will remain **free forever for everyone**
- The advanced and experimental features will require a small monthly payment of $4.99 to enjoy.

My hope is that with your continuous support, I will be able to keep on improving TS2 and release new features every ever 2 to 3 months (I do have a long list of new features as well as other productivity extensions... [WsL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/workspacelive/dlobignndchnmiaeeoldclglifpbdojo)üëÄ.

## Roadmap / Backlog

#### **Suggestions:**
  - [ ] Add support for context Menu
  - [ ] Save current tab to Clipboard - (sometimes we might want to copy all the url and not save them first ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
  - [x] enhance sort function
  - [ ] ignore on merge - TS2 will ignore specific URLS when merging all windows
  - [x] revisit Deduplicate & ignore after delimiter
  - [ ] <s>Add a whitelist to prevent deduplicating on specifics URLs</s>
  - [ ] ignore params after special characters - #,& ( expected to affect - sorting, deduplicating)
  - [x] Optional sorting on pinned tabs
  - [ ] deduplicate on all windows not just the current one
  - [ ] Welcome page / Wiki and Documentation
  - [x] Safari and Mozilla experimentation

#### **Enhancements:**
  - [ ] add behavioral options to remove redundant all/current buttons?
  - [ ] Undo last 2 action

#### **Wild Ideas:**
These are some ideas that I have been thinking about, but have yet to figure out their feasibility and if they are worth investing dev time.
  - [ ] split in multiple layout patterns.. e.i: 3x1, 4*4
  - [ ] add Group support to sorting/merging/split
  - [x] save and reload tab groups (the tabGroup API isn't sorting friendly...)
  - [ ] user defined functionalities?
